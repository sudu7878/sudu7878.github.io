      <h2>Video Editing</h2>
       <h4>Let's get real, if you want to make something meaningful, and not just random mess of video files here and there, you need to learn video editing. It's not about just cutting-pasting videos or adding large amounts of transitions and effects, its about presenting the video clips the way that its meaningful and have an impact. So here I am, trying to get better at it! Check out my works below!</h4>
       <br>
       <h4>Also you might be wondering why most of the things are same as that of cinematic stuff: that's because there is equal amount of efforts to edit an video as that to design the set and capture shots, it's kinda like the "final execution" to show the audience the content we have produced. Also you'll see my editing side of journey for each project.</h4>

      <p class="sample-description">
        This is the showcase video of an imaginary Minecraft village with Unreal Engine 5 to give it a cinematic meaning, I first used the entry scene from a dark room that increases the viewer's curiousity of the environment. Next I kind of play the scene with the music structure and synced it according to it to give a nice structure and flow. My most favourite scene was at timestamp 0.27 where the main music drops and I finally show the main structure of the market with nice cinematic lighting. Also, one more interesting fact is that if you look closely at the first scene, I have used dissolve from black (where I actually changed the camera's exposure) to give it a dreamy feel as the music also gives that vive with sounds of sparkles and all. At the end I add a yellow flash to sum up the project. I think this whole structure and timings of appropriate scenes kinda add up to the maximum "imaginative" impact.

      <p class="sample-description">
        This is actually an announcement trailer for the Roblox game "The Elevator" by Dream Games. Let me be real, the whole scene is a single camera tween shot captured in Unreal Engine 5. There's not much editing, because the goal of the trailer was to be "simple yet mysterious". The theme of the game was retro styled with VHS and all, so I conceptualized the storyline of this trailer as a narrative by a News reporter through a VHS tape: kinda like the Poppy Playtime VHS. To "immersify" the audience, I've slowly changed the aspect ratio from the standard VHS size to normal cinematic ratio. Plus, you will also hear the audio being less distorted and "speakery" and be an actual narrative along with maintaining the seriousness of the scene. To exaggerate the theme, I've re-distorted the voice of the reporter when the camera starts to shake violently (again intentional to show the power of the creature) along with chromatic aberration to give the viewers a feeling that their heads are going heavy.

      <p class="sample-description">
        This is my most recent cinematic wedding promo. I wanted to make Priya and Kiran's special day, more special. The shots were not captured by me and I acted solely as an Editor. This actually took me a whole day to complete. The goal was to make it like a movie: where the scenes play according to the meaning and the structure of the music. The main challenge here was to skim through thousands of footages and clips to find the best matching ones and then adding them together meaningfully, which in this case, is guided by the music. I added dramatic effects like the one when the Bride is commiting her entry the shot goes from black-white to color symbolizing the colors would be now entering the lives of both the families and the camera's movement from diagonal top to bottom and the celebration confetti particles play an amazing role together to give the emotional feeling. This was just one example of the analogy used to add effects in the project. I also added some color grading to make the scenes match their emotions. I showed Priya and Kiran this promo, and they absolutely loved it! That was my greatest win!

      <p class="sample-description">
        This was actually created for a local competition by KDMC. The goal here was to enfore awareness among people of Kalyan city about the rising problem of air pollution. Since this problem wasn't just confined to Kalyan city, I tried "my" way of spreading awareness where I actually included the use of "non-dialogue" storytelling and cinematography to rasie the awareness. The main thing important here was the way I tell the story. my concept was to make people say "damn, this is what we're doing and this is what our future will be looking like" for this reason, I first used the forest shots to hook up the people because well, the research says people are most likely to stop when they see something which they percieve as "beautiful". When I'm done admiring the beauty of natural environment, I then morph the scene in to out future and make the energetic music in the background distorted. This would instantly bring a surprised face on the audience (or atleast I think so) and then give the important message. There was actually first version of this reel too, but I ditched it last moment because first, the storyline and message was not clear to the audience in the first glance, and on shorts, first glance is everything. Secondly, it just kinda didn't have a meaningful structure, so one night before submission I quickly rendered two extra scenes and then made the final version.

      <p class="sample-description">
        This was the reel created by me for Ridansh's birthday, I wanted to embrace those cute and happy moments on his 1st Birthday! The goal here was to "summarize" the events so that includes the inclusion of his parents, relatives, people who attended the function and ofcourse, Ridansh! While the reel doesn't include any flashy effects, I think it still manages to give the vibe. Most of the footages were kinda shaky so I had to stablize them rather heavily so you could see some smearing in some footages. The music used was adequetly matching the theme and feel of the event and it worked together kinda perfectly.

      <p class="sample-description">
        I was again, actually getting bored and wanted to do something, so I took my camera and started capturing little things. The main goal of this project was to create something that I'll remember years later. The music, "Marry On A Cross" by Ghost actually suited because of its score and not its meaning, because it had that nostalgic vibe. The sequence of the clips didn't actually matter here because it was just a normal showcase with no storyline or anything. So the only thing I did here was I synced the shots to the musical beats to send the emotion to the spine (okay that's a very exaggerated term, but it is true for me atleast). I would specifically talk about the last scene, with the diya, because that's my favourite one; if you look closely, you may find some lens flare which is upside down of the diya appearing just about top of the main diya real object. That scene was actually best suited for credits kinda stuff and it was beautiful in its own way. So I added a little credit section there.

      <p class="sample-description">
        This one's actually my MOST favourite promo, though I made it when I was relatively new to create trailers and all from stack of footages. The cinematographer did an AMAZING job capturing special and cute moments of the couple and it was surprisingly easy for me to decide which clips to put where, which is again, according to the music. My most favourite scene from the whole promo is at timestamp 0.48. The scene is just...magical, and cannot be expressed by words. It's literally where the perfect cinematography, lighting, music AND most importantly, their true love, mix together to create a beautiful masterpiece that literally gives goosebumps. I just felt so good working on this project, I just felt so grateful haha! I also added dreamy look to that scene to show "it's a long awaited dream" because it was indeed, as it was their love marriage, I mean look at them, they look so happy! And for some reason, it makes me happy too! Though I know I kinda messed up color grading and made it excessively reddish and warm, but this was my first time grading a footage, so I think these mistakes are kinda acceptable LOL.

      <p class="sample-description">
         In Hinduism, "Haldi Ceremony" is celebrated as a celebration before a wedding. You see, Haldi means "turmeric" and it has some anti-bacterial properties that symbolize removal of harmful powers and spirits and to purify the Groom and the Bride. It's also the function where all the elders come together and celebrate wellbeing of the bridegroom's relationship. On the Wedding day, the daughter has to make her heart to leave her parents' home where she spent her childhood and to move and start into a new world. So, sometimes, bride does cry, and it's actually the most intense moment of any woman's life. It's a very emotional side of marriage. Therefore here, I've tried to "celebrate" that change, that emotional bonding, which is just a masterpiece created by god with his own hands. Honestly? the content itself is so powerful that it doesn't need editing, but the editing needs it. It's just the heart and soul of the whole promo. But the sequence was that Haldi is celebrated first and then the wedding. So, I had to merge them both into a single promo since they were conducted on the single day. Also, I think I managed color grading pretty well here, especially for the outside shots.

      <p class="sample-description">
         This is actually one of my old projects and was actually created for practice. Again, the cinematographer did an amazing job capturing shots. For the context, it was a Marathon organized by Rotary Club to promote physcial wellbeing among children along with some MLAs and Ministers. This was just kinda like a flashback and the basic sequence was from the start of the marathon, to the main marathon to the end and some miscellaneous events that happened in between and then entry of MLA and prize distribution. The funny thing is, I actually used a way serious music as if everyone is going on a combat LOL. But I was thinking to make it as adventerous as possible and I kinda think I succeeded doing that, even if its 1% haha. Here, I didn't actually use any color grading stuff because I found it boring and wasn't really enlightened by its importance (i swear ill never make that mistake again). I think if I had added some reverb then it would sound like it's spatial and would suit the aerial scenes to give more immersion and sense of depth to the scene.

      <p class="sample-description">
         This might be my oldest cinematic and trailer video. As the name suggests, I created this for The Run Chapter 2, my own little horror game on Roblox. As a trailer, its main goal was to hook up the audience to tell the theme and everything of the game. Though here I didn't get much engagement, but I'm glad I still tried, I accept I actually don't know how to work with social media algorithm because I've never tried it. Anyways for this, obviously I was bound to use a scary and "riser personality" type music, add some texts relating to the theme and context, and adding subtle animations for text effects and title/date of release thing. I also took special care to match the cinematic shots naturally even though they are different, and I think overall the trailer does work well, and if I had worked on the engagement, I could have done a much better job at inviting players in Roblox haha.
