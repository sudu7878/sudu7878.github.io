      <h2>Cinematography</h2>
       <h4>Cinematography is a way of storytelling, and I love to tell stories indirectly. The art of selling emotions throguh conjucture of music and visuals, the lighting, camera tween, scene hierarchy, is just exciting in its own beautiful way. Check out my work below! (P.S. watch videos on full screen pweeaaasssee!)</h4>

      <p class="sample-description">
        This was actually my first Unreal Engine 5 cinematic, when I got my new graphics card (yaye!!). I was very excited to try out Unreal Engine 5 with the new GPU and I wanted to do something which was quick and good too (it wasn't quick at ALL btw, i swear, it took me whole day). So I was just randomly playing through songs in Spotify, until I got this song. I was immediately fascinated and my creative brain cells fired up the concept for this.  I knew I wanted to show minecraft's village market, mixing some Persian themed environment and evening lighting mode. Along with this, I added some haze and fog to give it a desert biome feel and improvide the dreamy look, because after all, its a dream!. Now about the main cinematic stuff, you could see I used slow tweening and lens focal effects to give that depth and immersion.Watch it on YouTube on fullscreen!

      <p class="sample-description">
        This is actually an announcement trailer for the Roblox game "The Elevator" by Dream Games. I was a part of the studio and made this whole trailer in Unreal Engine 5. Since this was an announcement trailer, I had to keep things as "lore" and "secrety", so I thought: simple things would make a maximum impact here that would excite people to explore more. About the cinematics, I wanted to embrace that "lore" and mysterious emotion, so the camera shots are slow and still. The lights blinking at the end kind of establish the seriousness of the scene and the chromatic aberration sums up that effect. Since the game has retro styled theme, I wanted to convert the narrative from the news reporter's VHS at the start to real, immersive footage at the end. Besure to watch it on YouTube on fullscreen!

      <p class="sample-description">
        As on with my first indie psychological horror game made in Unreal Engine 5, this is the main menu background overlay that loops beneath the UI layer. The theme of the game itself is the calmeness in darkenss and this this footage sells that emotion. The sound design includes whispers and children crying strengthning the dark psychology about death. The calm cinematic camera tween also helps to establish that lone emotion. The stopped time in the scene symbolizes death is above time. You cannot delay it nor prepond it. The difference between in time between the analoge clock and the digital clock is the lore itself tied to the game that I cannot reveal (lol). The station and everything itself is directed and produced by me. This project is rendered in Unreal Engine 5 and edited in Premiere Pro. Watch it on YouTube in fullscreen!

      <p class="sample-description">
        This was actually created for a local competition by KDMC. The goal here was to enfore awareness among people of Kalyan city about the rising problem of air pollution. Since this problem wasn't just confined to Kalyan city, I tried "my" way of spreading awareness where I actually included the use of "non-dialogue" storytelling and cinematography to rasie the awareness. The choice of the song, "It's a beautiful day" by Akon, was I think perfect, because I wanted to give a lesson that, natural things are indeed responsible in making our day beautiful, and plus the emotional and cinematic music score helped set the stage for what I wanted to create. This whole sequence was created in 2 days inside Unreal Engine 5. You can view it on YouTube, though I don't know why I cannot embed the link here for some reason.

  <h4>These were some cinematics that were created very recently, but I've been doing cinematography stuff since my early ages, yeah, I know there's a LOT to improve, but I'm proud of where I've got today! Check out my old works! (again, they're...cringey)</h4>

      <p class="sample-description">
        This is one of my very early cinematic projects that I did in the lockdown, where I was bored and couldn't think of anything. I had Radha-Krishn statue on my desk and some decorative sea shells, a portable laptop table, amber tree and some peackock leaves (which are symbollic to the theme) and a nice miniature home. I assembled the scene and took the shots with the camera placed on a stool to have vertical stabilization, but that didnt have smooth lateral stabilization, hence you can see the some shots were kinda "laggy". I didn't have a gimbal to do this, and was mostly done without any professional cinematic tools except DSLR, it was shot on Canon EOS R. I also didn't do any color grading because I actually didn't care about it back then.

      <p class="sample-description">
        I was again, actually getting bored and wanted to do something, so I took my camera and started capturing little things. The main goal of this project was to create something that I'll remember years later. The music, "Marry On A Cross" by Ghost actually suited because of its score and not its meaning, because it had that nostalgic vibe. This actually taught me to find little things to admire and how they make up most of our day. Also, my dad had bought a new 35-mm lens and I couldn't wait to try it, so there I gave my shot. From this whole project, my favourite scene is the last one where there is also an inverted image of diya's flame disguised as lens flare. Physics is really awesome. Also this project was shot solely by hand and I didn't use any professional cinematography tools. (Also for some reason the YouTube embed isn't working, so you might wanna watch it by click the link, sorry bout that!')
